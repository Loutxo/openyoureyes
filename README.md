OpenYourEyes
============


What is
-------
Yet another augmented reality framework for Android

Introduction
------------
The basic idea is giving to develpers the possibility ignoring all the aspects based on GIS. So a developer can ignore the GPS, gyroscope, compass sensors and everything used to draw on a Canvas the augmented reality concepts.

How it works (if it works)
--------------------------
The main architecture used by openyoureyes it's based on MVC pattern: a controller read the configuration file with the _n_ content providers of geo datas, then inform the canvas that some new items was received
